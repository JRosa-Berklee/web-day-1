<h1>Sinking Ship</h1>
<h2>The Backseat Lovers</h2>
<h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
<p>Drivin' in silence<br>
    A trip around the world<br>
    Our hands haven't touched in more than a month<br>
    In my head there's sirens, warning me of pain<img src:"/Users/joshrosa/Downloads/ori_3501091_90c76f1262b4897092d7e1f61571a93e9f33fafa_emergency-flashing-police-siren-vector-illustration.jpg"><br>
    Will this be the night that I make things right?<br>    
    Or make things wrong<br>
    Or make things wrong<br>
    Or make things wrong<br></p>

<h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
<p>Your eyes used to wander<img src:"/Users/joshrosa/Downloads/64e654f59eee4d4efd7c0fa31ed9b2c1.jpg"><br>
    But now they sit in place<br>
    I'm sick of all of the nothing on your face<br>
    Did I put the fire out?<img src:"/Users/joshrosa/Downloads/city_of_madison_electric_fire_truck_emergency_lights-scaled.jpg"><br>
    Did I walk away?<br>
    Did I burn up all the oxygen and throw the rest away?<br></p>

<h3>[Verse 3]</h3>
<p>And I don't want to be the ball to your chain<img src:"/Users/joshrosa/Downloads/image-asset.jpeg"><br>
    Seems that every time the weather's on our side<br>
    I turn it right<br>
    Back into rain<br></p>

<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
Don't hold back<br>
Don't wait for the night to end<br>
If it's me you're waiting on, then I say spend<br>
Your time on someone else's sinking ship<br> <img src:"/Users/joshrosa/Downloads/titanic_custom-a7161a7b82be4249365df5349d977dc0a652102a.jpg">

<h3>[Verse 4]</h3>
Try to substitute my dreams with you<br>
And you brought me down on the ship<br>
(This ship called life)<br>

<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
Don't hold back<br>
Don't wait for the night to end<br>
If it's me you're waiting on then I say spend<br>
Your time on someone else's sinking ship<br>
